Slide 1 – Introduction (Motivation and Problem in Brief)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Title: XpertKarate – Intelligent Tournament Management System for Karate
- Motivation:
  - Manual management of karate tournaments (registrations, draws, judge assignment, scoring, payments) is time‑consuming, error‑prone, and difficult to scale.
  - Stakeholders (players, coaches, judges, organizers, and admins) currently rely on fragmented tools such as spreadsheets, messaging apps, and paper-based score sheets.
  - Growing number of tournaments and participants demands automation, transparency, and real-time information.
- Problem Statement (brief):
  - There is a lack of an integrated, role-based, real-time system specifically tailored for karate tournaments that supports end‑to‑end workflows from registration and payments to AI‑assisted draw generation and live scoring.


Slide 2 – Existing Solutions and Alternatives
---------------------------------------------
- Existing Tools / Systems:
  - Generic sports management systems (e.g., SportEngine, Tournament Software, league management platforms) – support basic scheduling and results but are not tailored to karate rules (Kata/Kumite rounds, belt/age/weight categories, judge panels).
  - Manual tools: Excel/Google Sheets for entries and draws, WhatsApp/Facebook for communication, paper-based score sheets and manual result compilation.
  - Some karate federations use custom web tools, but often:
    - Limited support for multi‑role dashboards (Player, Coach, Judge, Organizer, Admin).
    - Limited or no AI‑assisted draw generation.
    - Limited real‑time updates and integrated online payments.
- Comparison with XpertKarate (high-level):
  - XpertKarate is karate‑specific (supports Kata and Kumite rules, belt/age/weight categories, team and individual events).
  - Provides integrated modules: registration, payments (PayHere), draw generation (with Gemini AI support), live scoring, notifications, reports, and chatbot.
  - Offers role‑based dashboards and Socket.IO–powered real‑time updates, which many existing tools either lack or provide only partially.
  - Literature/Conceptual References (to be cited in report/presentation):
    - Research on sports tournament management systems and decision support tools.
    - Studies on AI‑assisted scheduling and bracket generation in sports tournaments.


Slide 3 – Proposed Solution (Overview, Method, Technologies, Implementation)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solution Overview:
  - XpertKarate is a full‑stack web application that digitizes the complete karate tournament lifecycle: user management, tournament and category setup, registrations, payments, AI‑assisted draw generation, live scoring, judge assignment, reporting, and real‑time notifications.
  - It supports five main roles: Admin, Player, Coach, Judge, and Organizer, each with dedicated dashboards and workflows.
- Method / System Design:
  - Backend REST API (Node.js/Express + MongoDB) exposing endpoints for authentication, tournaments, categories, registrations, matches, scores, payments, notifications, chat, reports, and role management.
  - Frontend SPA (React + Tailwind CSS) consuming the API via Axios, with React Router–based navigation and role‑based protected routes.
  - Real‑time layer using Socket.IO for live scores, match status updates, and notifications.
  - AI integration:
    - Gemini API used as an intelligent draw‑generation assistant (for building fair brackets under constraints) and for the chatbot that answers user questions about tournaments and scoring.
  - Security and validation:
    - JWT‑based authentication, role‑based access control, server‑side validation using express‑validator, and secure payment integration with PayHere.
- Technologies Used:
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose), Socket.IO, Multer, Nodemailer, express‑validator.
  - Frontend: React 18, React Router v6, Axios, Socket.IO Client, Tailwind CSS, React Toastify, Vite.
  - External Services: PayHere payment gateway, Gemini AI API, SMTP email server.


Slide 4 – Results (Feature Implementation vs Initial Proposal)
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Promised / Planned Major Features:
  - Role‑based user management (Admin, Player, Coach, Judge, Organizer) with authentication and profile management.
  - Tournament and category management (Kata/Kumite, individual/team events, age/belt/weight categories).
  - Registration and approval workflows with payment integration.
  - AI‑assisted match draw generation (Gemini) with fallback algorithm.
  - Live scoring for Kata and Kumite with multiple judges.
  - Judge assignment via Tatami and schedule management.
  - Real‑time dashboards and notifications.
  - Reports and exports (Kata/Kumite reports, results, and data export).
  - Chat and AI chatbot support.
- Implementation Status (summary):
  - **Implemented:** Authentication & user management, tournament/category management, registrations, PayHere payment integration, AI‑assisted and fallback draw generation, live Kata and Kumite scoring, judge assignment and Tatami management, dashboards for all roles, real‑time notifications and scoring via Socket.IO, reports, profile management, chat and chatbot features.
  - **Partially Implemented / Configurable:** Some advanced security/performance and AI features depend on correct environment configuration (e.g., Gemini API keys, PayHere sandbox/production, email server settings).
  - **Not Implemented / Future:** Any additional advanced analytics or mobile app components beyond the current scope (see Slide 6).


Slide 5 – Results (Testing and Comparison with Existing Systems)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Testing Performed:
  - Comprehensive test plan with 200+ detailed test cases across modules:
    - Authentication & User Management, Tournament & Category Management, Registrations, Payments, Draw Generation, Kata & Kumite scoring, Judge Assignment, Dashboards, Notifications, Reports, Profile Management, Security & Authorization, Performance & Load, Integration, UI/UX, Real‑time features, Chat/Chatbot, Dojo and Admin management, Scheduling, Results, Search/Filter, Error handling.
  - Integration tests validate complete flows (e.g., registration → approval → payment → draw generation → scoring → results).
  - Performance tests (e.g., dashboard load times, draw generation with large participant sets, concurrent logins, real-time updates).
- Test Results (high-level):
  - Majority of high‑priority test cases passed in the configured environment.
  - System handles normal tournament sizes efficiently; draws and real‑time updates work within acceptable response times.
  - Security tests confirm proper protection for roles and input validation (e.g., access control, XSS/SQL injection prevention at application level).
- Comparison with Existing Solutions:
  - Provides deeper karate‑specific support (Kata/Kumite logic, multi‑round Kata, Kumite scoring model, belt/age/weight‑based categories).
  - Integrates AI (Gemini) for draw generation and chatbot, which is typically absent in generic tools.
  - Offers stronger role separation and real‑time experience (Socket.IO) compared to manual or semi‑automated solutions.


Slide 6 – Conclusion (Summary, Limitations, Future Work)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Summary:
  - XpertKarate successfully implements an end‑to‑end, karate‑specific tournament management system with integrated registration, payments, AI‑assisted draw generation, live scoring, judge assignment, real‑time dashboards, reporting, and chatbot support.
  - Compared to existing generic or manual solutions, it improves efficiency, transparency, and user experience for all stakeholder roles.
- Limitations:
  - Relies on stable internet connectivity and server availability (less suitable for venues with very poor connectivity).
  - AI‑based features (Gemini) and payment gateway integration depend on external services and correct configuration of API keys and sandbox/production environments.
  - Currently optimized for web; no dedicated native mobile apps.
- Future Work:
  - Develop native mobile applications (Android/iOS) for judges, players, and coaches with offline‑first support.
  - Enhance AI modules for more advanced scheduling/optimization and predictive analytics (e.g., performance trends, load forecasting).
  - Add deeper federation‑level features such as multi‑tournament series, ranking systems across events, and integration with national/international karate bodies.
  - Further automate analytics dashboards and reporting for organizers and admins.
